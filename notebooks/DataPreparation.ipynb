    "**Personalized recommendation system**\\\n",
    "In context of personalized recommendations (unique for each user) we only need to store rating user gave, and to what product is was given to, resulting in tuple `customer_id`, `product_id` and `star_rating`. However, to make this data more appropricate and actually suitable for models, we should clear it from outliers, make some assumptions about 'usefullness' and 'acutality' of reviews given. For that reason it would make sence to store all columns that could be used as filteres in next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Data Understanding](https://github.com/akmchnkv/Amazon-Predictions-Data-Mining-Innopolis-2024/blob/main/notebooks/EDA.ipynb), we can say that columns `marketplace`, `product_category` could be removed entirely as they only contain 1 unique value throuout all the rows. In addition, we can also disgard `vine` due to huge class disbalance (can't filter by vine=1, and vine=0 as it would chande distributions). \n",
    "\n",
    "In given architecture we also decided not to use `product_title` as it could not be used as filter due to it's variability and 'text'-nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalized recommendation system**\\\n",
    "In the context of universal recommendations we can use almost all values that describe product. We can use text embeddings, star ratings, even headlines and dates as a features to develop a model. The only features we would disgard in this case are `marketplace`, `product_category` for the same reasons mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we will prepare data only for **Personalized recommendation systems** as they correlate more with our business objective, however with a few changes (add 1 columns) we can make dataset for **Generalized recommendation systems**."
